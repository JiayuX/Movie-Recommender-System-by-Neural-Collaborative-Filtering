# Movie-Recommender-System-by-Neural-Collaborative-Filtering
In this project, we build and train a movie recommender system based on neural collaborative filtering.

The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sherinclaudia/movielens). The data files need to be placed in the folder named 'data'.

We treat the rating from the users on the movies as a bianry implicit interaction, i.e. 0 for no interaction and 1 for observed interaction. The positive samples (1) is quite sparse as could be visualized by the image representing the user-movie interaction matrix.
